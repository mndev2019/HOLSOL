      content: `The Indian government has announced a significant reduction in 
      the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on solar equipment, bringing it down to just 5%. 
      This policy shift is set to make solar systems more affordable for households and 
      businesses alike. Experts believe this move will accelerate the adoption of clean energy, 
      support Indiaâ€™s renewable energy targets, and reduce dependency on fossil fuels. 
      With installation costs dropping, more families and organizations can now contribute 
      to a sustainable future powered by the sun.`,
